<h1><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Linux</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Linux is an open-source operating system, which means anyone can use it, tweak it, and share it freely. Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux comes in many different flavors, called “distributions” or distros, like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian, each with its own look, feel, and features.</span></p>
